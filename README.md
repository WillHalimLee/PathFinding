# PathFinding
A Demo that will compare different algorithms.
This program will compare the pathing and graph traversal speeds of three algorithms for Shortest Path, A*, BSF, and DIJKSTRA. 

Credit: GUI implementaion by Ryi Snow "Step by Step Explanation of A* Pathfinding Algorithm in Java" Youtube video for the A* implementation.

Instructions.
In Panel class, change the maxRow, maxCol to create the desired sized map.
Find the method called setTest() and add inside it the starting node and Goal Node.
You may create walls by calling setSolidNode and giving it a x y coordinate.

Press 1 to manualy step through the A* algorithm.
Press 2 to automatically run the A* algoirthm. The run time in milli Seconds, chosen path length, and number of nodes visted will be displayed on the console.

Press 3 to manualy step through the Greedy Best First Search algorithm.
Press 4 to automatically run the Greedy BFS algoirthm. The run time in milli Seconds, chosen path length, and number of nodes visted will be displayed on the console.

Press 5 to manualy step through the Dijkstra's algorithm.
Press 6 to automatically run the Dijkstra's algoirthm. The run time in milli Seconds, chosen path length, and number of nodes visted will be displayed on the console.

Press R to reset the panel.
